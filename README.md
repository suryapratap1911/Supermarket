# **Supermarket Checkout System 🛒**  

## **Overview**  
This is a simple **Supermarket Checkout System** implemented in Python using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The system allows scanning products, applying bulk discounts, and calculating the total bill dynamically.  

## **Features**  
✔️ Supports individual product pricing and bulk discount offers.  
✔️ Dynamically updates the cart as products are scanned.  
✔️ Uses a structured **OOP-based approach** for better readability and scalability.  
✔️ Efficiently calculates the final bill by applying pricing rules.  

## **How It Works**  

### **1. Pricing Rules & Bulk Offers**  
Each product has a **unit price** and can have a **bulk discount offer**.  
For example:  
- Product **A** costs **50** per unit but has a bulk deal: **3 for 130**.  
- Product **B** costs **30** per unit but has a bulk deal: **2 for 45**.  
- Products **C & D** have fixed prices of **20 & 15**, respectively, with no discounts.  

### **2. Scanning Products & Calculating Total**  
When a product is scanned, it is added to the cart, and the quantity is updated.  
Once all products are scanned, the **total bill** is calculated.  

#### **Example Scenario**  
Let's say a customer buys: **"DABABA"** (i.e., Products: D, A, B, A, B, A)  

- 🏷 **Product D:** 1 unit → 15  
- 🏷 **Product A:** 3 units → Bulk price **130**  
- 🏷 **Product B:** 2 units → Bulk price **45**  

💰 **Total Bill:** `130 + 45 + 15 = 190`  

### **3. Running the Code**  
To test the system, run:  

```bash
python supermarket_checkout.py
```

Output:  
```
Total Purchase Amount: $1.90 or 190
```

## **Code Structure Approach**  

This project follows an **Object-Oriented Approach (OOP)** for clarity and modularity:  

- **Encapsulation:**  
  - The logic for pricing, cart management, and checkout is kept separate for maintainability.  

- **Modular Design:**  
  - Pricing rules and cart updates are handled independently.  
  - The system can be extended easily (e.g., adding new discount rules or products).  

- **Efficiency:**  
  - The bulk pricing logic ensures that discounts are applied without unnecessary recalculations.  
  - The total is computed dynamically, making it adaptable for large carts.

## **Conclusion**  

This **Supermarket Checkout System** efficiently calculates purchase totals, applying bulk discounts where necessary. The **OOP-based** approach ensures **scalability, readability, and maintainability**.  

🚀 **Future Enhancements:**  
🔹 Support for different discount types (e.g., Buy 1 Get 1 Free).  
🔹 Implement barcode scanning for real-world applications.  
🔹 Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.  

📌 **This project demonstrates the power of modular, well-structured OOP design in solving real-world retail problems.**  

**Happy Coding & Shopping!** 🛒
